> It's never too late to learn someting new

Hello, user!

I started learning 3D modelling in 2018 just as a hobby. I'm having a lot of fun with it and starting to dedicate more time for modelling. My projects age getting more complicated, so I started using Git.

This is my private repo with Blender projects. Each **folder** within the repo represents **one separate project**. There's also **Renders** folders inside the project with final results.
